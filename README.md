# This is Capstone Project Which I have worked on during my training with Intellipaat. 
In this Project I have worked on Cryptography. 
In short if I tell you there was a encrypted file which I had to decrypt it and based on the decrytption result I had to asnwer what does that encryption consisits. 
It was Bash 64 Encryption and I decoded using Burpsuite - however there are plenty of plateform out there which we can use to decrypt Bash64 encryptions. 

I also worked on Malware like and specided what are the tools are there available for the Malware Analysis.
